bash-change-sound-device
========================

Very simple bash script to toggle through all output sound devices

Basically I needed a way to quickly toggle between my sound devices and I figured doing it at 6 AM is a good idea.. after a bit of messing around with bash it was finished for my needs. I set it up as a custom keybind in Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon on Alt+s.

I'm 100% sure there are places to improve it but it works for me and it's too early to go deeper into the abyss with it :)

In it current iteration it will also notify you through "notify-send" with the name of the new sound device, feel free to disable it if it's not needed.
